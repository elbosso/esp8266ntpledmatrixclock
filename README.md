# esp8266ntpledmatrixclock

This repository actually combines what i learned from building
https://github.com/elbosso/sonoffSocket
and 
https://github.com/elbosso/esp8266epaperdoorsign
with an MAX7119 8x8 Led Matrix (well - actually four of them) and
a photo resistor.

And so we have a nifty little clock...
